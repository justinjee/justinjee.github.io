<p><b>Essay in response to the question &ldquo;Ideally, how will scientists share their results with each other and the public in 50 years?&rdquo;</b></p><br>
<p>I know it sounds crazy, but I'm going to go with brain Internet. Trying to read all the papers on, say, autism or brown dwarfs 50 years from now (or even today) will be impossible. Even with the help of well-crafted databases, you'd spend too much time manually prowling those databases for what is relevant (when you could be doing experiments), even with search engines. You want truly personalized structure, integration, and filters? You want it fast? Cut out the middle man. Get brain Internet. Individuals will each possess their own private brain Internet cache, and when a new experiment is performed, the cache will update. The way each update is processed will be unique to each individual, because plasticity&minus;what is perceived as important enough to remodel dendrites thus linking past with present experiences&minus;is unique. Plus, you can buy a special filter to keep from turning into a zombie.</p><br>
