When they built the transcontinental railroad, they started from both sides of the country.<br><br>
There's this notion that thinking mathematically, or scientifically, is incompatible with thinking 
emotionally, or artistically. There is this idea that they are orthogonal vectors which meet only at zero 
before shooting off into infinity in their own directions.<br><br>
We have to bring them together. Why shouldn't it be possible?  Science is all about understanding. You say art 
isn't something that can be understood? Art is about communication. Art is about choices made with reasons, 
however subconscious or complicated or imaginative they may be. You say science is impersonal? 
Science has its roots in philosophy, the search for truth. What is truth? Truth is knowing something eternal, 
some kind of understanding. There can be no truth without a mind to understand truth. And minds are made of 
human flesh. We are an imperfect prediction machine. That is why we are here. Our reaction to art is based around 
how it blends and clashes with the way our prediction machine sees the world. We see if the choices of others 
make sense with our own understanding. In this context, art makes no sense without science.<br><br>
So I try to work from both sides, and I dig deep, and lay in tracks through the mountains, because at least 
by working both sides I can see the point where the tracks will converge.<br><br>
