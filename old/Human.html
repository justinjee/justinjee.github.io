<p align="Justify"><font face="Courier New" size=2>Here's what I think. Art is a series of choices, but not just any choices, they're your best choices.
The ones you get to think about, erase if you don't like them, make them better. By getting to know someone's art you get to know them at their best.
The friction of life comes from accidents, miscommunications, misunderstandings. I think that with art people can truly understand each other.
I think that by practicing art, you can't help but live your life more like someone who creates art. You start to think about your choices more, 
and how they affect other people. Art makes you soft, makes you malleable to people you meet. That's why I like art.
