I don't totally get this whole science thing. On the one hand, it's supposed to 
help us stay honest. On the other hand, a lot of it is moving in a direction where 
the most popular findings are the ones that have the most expensive equipment and 
the most collaborators. Not that there's anything wrong with sequencing experiments or 
high-energy particle physics experiments, and I definitely have nothing against collaborators! 
I just think a little individuality is being lost along the way. And if running Southern Blots 
can't be intimately intertwined into your own individuality, are they really worth doing? 
<br><br>Despite this, I do research, because I think it is worth it: <a href="http://mdphd.med.nyu.edu/people/justin-jee">Me@NYU</a>
