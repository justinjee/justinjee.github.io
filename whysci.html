<p><b>Essay written for <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/faculty/stephenhall/">Stephen Hall&rsquo;s</a> science writing class.</b></p><br>
<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when I was in kindergarten. My father worked for NASA, and he brought me posters of Jupiter and Saturn to take to show and tell. </p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when, in eighth grade, I entered the California State Science Fair. My project: simulating the acoustics of musical instruments using trigonometric functions. My father taught me about the least squares method, higher harmonics, and the beauty of simple solutions. My eighth grade teacher told me my project had too much math.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when, during the California State Science fair, I learned about Mandelbrot fractals by reading the poster of a fellow entrant. As a thirteen-year-old, I empathized with how a bump on a curve might possess infinite complexity, if someone would look closer.</p>

<p>I knew I would never be a scientist when the winners of the California State Science Fair were announced, and I was not one of them.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when I asked my high school guidance counselor if I could do a summer internship in California State University Fullerton&rsquo;s chemistry department. She replied that students who had worked there in the past were &ldquo;thrown in the deep end,&rdquo; and were on the school&rsquo;s Science Olympiad team&mdash;her way of saying I wasn&rsquo;t smart enough. </p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when, in high school, my friends on the Science Olympiad team introduced me to a professor in California State University Fullerton&rsquo;s chemistry department. We spent summer modeling the breakage and formation of chemical bonds. When our mentor left for a trip to China, my friends spent the afternoons playing tennis.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when, while working in a chemistry modeling lab, I discovered that a &ldquo;known&rdquo; chemical reaction leading to sulfuric acid was wrong. I had imagined the diagrams in our lab textbooks as concrete pillars. I was now a sledgehammer. </p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when I was making the figures for my first paper.</p>

<p>I knew I would never be a scientist when I entered the Siemens Westinghouse Science Competition and lost to my friends who played tennis.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when, in college, I learned that if bacteria search for food but can&rsquo;t smell where it&rsquo;s coming from, they do a random walk that is ultimately driven by thermodynamic noise. Bacterial free will is no different from air particles bouncing around in space! </p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when I worked in a natural products lab. We traveled to the rainforests of Ecuador to collect endophytes, the fungi and bacteria that dwell inside plants, then hauled them back to the lab in Ziploc bags. One experiment we would do: stick an endophyte on one end of a petri dish and a pathogen on the other end, then wait to see which would dominate the plate, gladiator-style. We didn&rsquo;t find any endophytes to cure staph infections, but we did find some that ate plastic.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when the coolest thing I could think of went from being Jack Bauer to being slime molds.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when my graduate advisor and I debated the origin of life, each of us using more and more complex mathematical ideas to outwit each other, citing obscure biological facts, delving deeper and deeper into the logic of how a primordial RNA world could evolve.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to be a scientist when our paper describing a model for RNA world evolution was attacked on a creationist blog.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;ll never be a scientist when, every week, I read about how NIH funding is collapsing; how there are three hundred graduate students and postdocs for every open faculty position; how experiments have demonstrated that scientists value papers based on what journal they&rsquo;re published in rather than their content.</p>

<p>I know I want to be a scientist whenever it&rsquo;s late at night and my head is so full of thoughts about evolution, probability functions, and crazy things we can do with microbes that it&rsquo;s going to explode. </p>

<p>Will I be a scientist?</p>

<p>Life is an experiment. Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
