<p><b>Letter in response to <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v499/n7457/full/nj7457-245a.html">&ldquo;Music meets science&rdquo;</a></b></p><br>

<p>My first piano lesson in college, my teacher said, &ldquo;You play like a scientist.&rdquo; It was not a compliment. I think about that whenever a scientist says that research is an art (I&lsquo;ve yet to hear an artist do likewise with science). Recently, Detournay (Nature 499, 245:2013) discussed similarities between scientific research and music composition. They both undergo phases of &ldquo;onset, development, refinement, and exposition.&rdquo; But so do hedge fund management and tomato farming. 
</p>
<p>On a deeper level, the one thing that binds music and science is the notion that sincere, personal investment in one&rsquo;s work is good . Many associate this idea with artists but not scientists, so it is understandable that some scientists label themselves &ldquo;artists&rdquo; and point to the similarities. But science and art are not the same. Science is the pursuit of truth, and it lives on one emotion: the thrill of discovery. Music is about evoking and savoring the emotions themselves.
